## Overview

This project took a bit longer to execute because I had to review my Javascript. I mainly focused on .addEventListener and classList.toggle, which were the rules I used for executing the hidden and image transition and for clicking outside the menu, which then hides the menu again. 
HTML felt a lot quicker to execute. However, the CSS this time around was a little bit more challenging since I had to pair it with Javascript to make sure the functionality was responding correctly. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
I did start off with a mobile-first workflowâ€”it felt much easier to execute. However, the background image URL () was a bit tricky. Trying to position it through CSS could have been better.

My process had a quicker execution, i.e., HTML & CSS : 

--Setting up the tags, groups, and names, respectively, according to their purpose

CSS was quick as well, including styling the containers, sizing, positioning, and all the small details. 

--JavaScript was not as basic as I thought it was going to be

Summary: HTML --> CSS --> JavaScript --> CSS --> JavaScript


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to execute classList, toggle, and addEventListener, which gave me exceptional insight into what I can continue to accomplish with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
